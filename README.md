# dependency-graph

A python script to show the "include" dependency of C++ classes.

It is useful to check the presence of circular dependencies.

## Installation

The script depends on [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) to draw the graph. 

On Ubuntu, you can install the dependencies with these two commands:

```
sudo apt install graphviz
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Manual

```
usage: dependency_graph.py [-h] [-f {bmp,gif,jpg,png,pdf,svg}] [-v] [-c]
                           folder output

positional arguments:
  folder                Path to the folder to scan
